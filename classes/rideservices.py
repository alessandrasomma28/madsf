rideservices.py

This module defines the RideServices class, which manages ride offers and acceptances between passengers and drivers.
It supports the following operations:

1. step: Advances the ride service logic by generating new offers and checking for matches.
2. _generate_offers: Internal method to create offers for unassigned reservations and nearby idle taxis.
3. _check_matches: Internal method to dispatch taxis when both driver and passenger have accepted an offer.
4. accept_offer: Registers an acceptance of an offer by either a driver or passenger.
5. reject_offer: Registers a reject of an offer by either a driver or passenger and removes the related offer (and acceptance).
6. get_offers_for_drivers: Returns offers relevant to the given list of driver IDs.
7. get_offers_for_passengers: Returns offers relevant to the given list of passenger reservation IDs.
8. remove_offer: Removes an offer from the offers dict.
9. is_passenger_accepted: Returns True if the passenger has accepted a specific offer.
10. is_driver_accepted: Returns True if the driver has accepted a specific offer.
11. remove_acceptance: Removes an acceptance from the acceptances dict.
12. compute_offer: Computes travel time, route length, and price of a reservation.
13. compute_surge_multiplier: Computes the price multiplication factor based on the ratio between
    number of pending requests and number of available drivers.
