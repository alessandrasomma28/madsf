passengers.py

This module defines the Passenger class, which manages unassigned ride requests and
interacts with the ride service to accept/reject offers from drivers.
It supports the following operations:

1. step: Advances the passengers logic by:
    (i) Initializing the sets of requests, 
    (ii) Removing timed-out requests,
    (iii) Updating the set of unassigned requests,
    (iv) Assigning personalities to new passengers,
    (v) Processing offers from drivers, either considering social groups or not, and
    (vi) Logging the status of the passengers.
2. get_unassigned_requests: Returns the set of unassigned requests.
3. get_canceled_requests: Returns the set of canceled requests.
