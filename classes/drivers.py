drivers.py

This module defines the Drivers class, which manages idle drivers and
interacts with the ride service to accept offers from passengers.
It supports the following operations:

1. step: Advances the drivers logic by:
    (i) updating the set of idle drivers for both Uber and Lyft,
    (ii) distributing the personalities of new idle drivers,
    (iii) processing pending ride offers where the passenger has already accepted,
    (iv) assigning the best offer to each idle driver (who either accepts or rejects), and
    (v) cleaning up redundant offers.
2. get_idle_drivers: Returns the set of idle drivers.
3. get_idle_drivers_by_provider: Returns a dictionary containing the two sets of Uber and Lyft available drivers.
4. get_driver_timeout: Returns the timeout value for the driver.
