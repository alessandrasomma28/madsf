drivers.py

This module defines the Drivers class, which manages idle drivers and
interacts with the ride service to accept/reject offers from passengers.
It supports the following operations:

1. step: Advances the drivers logic by:
    (i) updating the set of idle drivers for the providers,
    (ii) distributing the personalities of new idle drivers,
    (iii) processing pending ride offers where the passenger has already accepted,
    (iv) assigning the best offer to each idle driver (who either accepts or rejects), and
    (v) cleaning up redundant offers.
    (vi) updating the logger with the current state of drivers.
2. get_idle_drivers: Returns the set of idle drivers.
3. get_idle_drivers_by_provider: Returns a dictionary containing the sets of available drivers by provider.
4. get_driver_provider: Returns the provider of a specific driver.
5. get_driver_timeout: Returns the timeout value for the driver.
6. get_total_offers: Returns the total number of offers made to drivers.
