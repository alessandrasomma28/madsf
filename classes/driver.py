driver.py

This module defines the Driver class, which manages idle drivers and
interacts with the ride service to accept offers from passengers.
It supports the following operations:

1. step: Advances the passenger logic by: (i) updating the set of idle drivers for both Uber and Lyft,
(ii) processing pending ride offers where the passenger has already accepted,
(iii) assigning the best offer to each idle driver, and (iv) cleaning up redundant offers.
2. get_idle_drivers: Returns the set of idle drivers.
3. get_idle_drivers_by_provider: Returns a dictionary containing the two sets of Uber and Lyft available drivers.
4. get_driver_timeout: Returns the timeout value for the driver.
